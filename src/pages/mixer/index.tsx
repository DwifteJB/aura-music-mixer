/*
two image boxes, one left, one right:

on hover over img show "press me to upload a file"

use id3 to read the tags and display img, else generate img from name/file name

once click mix -> api request -> ws deals with ai split, queue, rate limit, etc.
-> real time updates -> then after, send 4 audio files
(song 1 vocals, song 1 instrumentals, song 2 vocals, song 2 instrumentals)

allow user to change volume, pitch, etc. of each file (SoundTouchJS)
then figure out how to mix them to be downloadable

then allow user to post -> public -> set album art, title, description

store data of the original file names/tags...


boom!!!!!!!!
