# Aurality Mixer

<img src="https://github.com/">

A music mixing program that allows you to clash two songs together!

## Info

This repo comes as 3 projects, the frontend, spleeter-server and backend

### Is there any AI, and where it is used?

Yes, this project uses spleeter to split the songs into two tracks, instrumentals and vocals! This is all self hosted, which explains the really big rate limit, since im running this on-device, paying for the electricity and the heat that is produced.... I am not paying 10$/day just to run a website sadly, unless I can somehow make something back. Outside of that, co-pilot was used to speed up development and I made one query for some help with Docker to setup the actual spleeter server, since I had such a headache with tensorflow and cuda containers. But everything of that is re-written! (still marked as AI)
